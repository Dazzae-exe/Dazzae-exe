## Hi there! 👋🏻
I am a Software Engineer based in Venezuela. As a dedicated SWE, I specialize in crafting high-quality products where sleek design meets rock-solid engineering. 
I thrive at the intersection of aesthetics and functionality, delivering visually captivating interfaces backed by scalable, performant code.

I am working in **Chicks Gold Inc** from Canada as Contractor Software Engineer currently. 

I've built more apps than all my repositories projects so far since I began my career. *I am still available and open for new opportunities.*

*I promise I will reach more than 1k commits next year.*

I am working on my own personal app to make more accesible tools for self-taught programmers, designers, CMs and, more. Also, I am opening back my old project `Pharos Market` which I will start after I land my app for self-taught people.

### My skills journey
- html
- css / scss / tailwindcss
- javascript / typescript (still learning this one tho)
- aurelia / react / svelte
- supabase / mongodb / firestore
- postgreSQL
