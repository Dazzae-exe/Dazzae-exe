## What do I do?
I am a student of [@Platzi](https://platzi.com) and I'm studying software development. I like the afternoon with coffee and code, gaming at night on weekends, freelancing, and looking for remote jobs in the mornings.

Free for open source projects, let's talk.
 
## Experiences
* I have worked with *Katavi Gaming Limited* for 1+ years using my knowledge and also, learning more about Svelte for different projects ongoing by the company.
* [_Upwork freelancer service of Web Development_](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01b2619ccbe701fea7).
* I supported react community by translating docs from English to Spanish for the new docs.
