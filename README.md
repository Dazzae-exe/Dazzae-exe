### Hi there! 👋🏻
I am a Software Developer from Venezuela who loves coffee and react. 
I like to practice code on Codedex in my free time. I wonder if I would get a nice idea for my startup someday...

### What am I learning?
I am learning TypeScript and more about building with Aurelia Framework.

### My daily stack
- html
- React / nextjs / aurelia
- css /scss / tailwindcss
- supabase
